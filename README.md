# Human-Action-Recognition
COMP90051 Statistical Machine Learning Project  
Human action recognition, i.e., recognizing the category of a human behaviour from a sequence, is very important in our daily life. Human action recognition techniques can be used in many applications such as detecting dangerous behaviours in visual surveillance and analysing pedestrian behaviours for safe operation in autonomous driving systems.

## Requirements 
In order to run our code, pytorch and tensorflow packages should be installed before run the code


## Software Setup 

Most of our work is done under the environment of python3.8 using Jupiter notebook, the environment setup is a time-consuming process. Most libraries could be downloaded using command line “pip install xxx” , whereas some requires to be based on virtual conda environment. Due to some special library usages of TensorFlow, it is sometimes requiring loading the package as “From tensorflow. python.keras import xxx” instead of “From tensorflow.keras import xxx”. Main libraries we used are Pandas (1.0.5), Numpy (1.18.5), Keras (2.6.0), Sklearn (0.24.2), Torch (1.9.0)
